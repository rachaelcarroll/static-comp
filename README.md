# *RANCH!*

## Overview

This project was completed in week 9 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).  The goal of this weekend-long solo [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp) was to replicate a static comp using HTML and CSS.  

Given the comp below, we were to recreate the layout, while having creative license with the color palette, icons, images, and copy.  As a ranch connoiseur, I chose to rank some of my favorite ranch brands. You can view the deployed site [here!]()

## Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- Utlizing a grid layout
- Writing clean and DRY HTML and CSS
- Making the site responsive to different screen sizes and across different browsers such as Firefox, Safari, and Chrome
- Using a reset or normalize. I chose to use Eric Meyer's Reset CSS file because I wanted the most consistency across all browsers.
